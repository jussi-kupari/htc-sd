GREGOR KICZALES: In this video we're going to start a big function design

2
00:00:07,580 --> 00:00:11,020
problem that's going to last through several videos,

3
00:00:11,020 --> 00:00:14,890
and it will lead us eventually to designing five functions.

4
00:00:14,890 --> 00:00:17,180
That's not at all unusual.

5
00:00:17,180 --> 00:00:21,980
In some function design problems you design many more functions than that.

6
00:00:21,980 --> 00:00:26,580
Imagine, for example, designing a function that consumes a location,

7
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:30,824
and drives a car from its current position to that location.

8
00:00:30,824 --> 00:00:32,740
I think you can easily imagine that that would

9
00:00:32,740 --> 00:00:36,560
involve many, many, many functions.

10
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:39,590
The one we're going to do now, though, starts with one function

11
00:00:39,590 --> 00:00:42,050
and will end up designing five.

12
00:00:42,050 --> 00:00:45,540
The basic problem is we have a bunch of pictures or images

13
00:00:45,540 --> 00:00:49,550
that we want to be able to store and present in different ways.

14
00:00:49,550 --> 00:00:52,940
This problem will do a simple version of the presentation,

15
00:00:52,940 --> 00:00:56,660
and later on will set the stage for more elaborate version.

16
00:00:56,660 --> 00:00:58,480
So there's two parts to this problem.

17
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:01,100
First we have to design a data definition to represent

18
00:01:01,100 --> 00:01:03,240
an arbitrary number of images.

19
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:07,040
And then we'll design a function to arrange those images in a nice way.

20
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:10,850
The video will pause here while you go ahead and do part a:

21
00:01:10,850 --> 00:01:15,800
design a data definition to represent an arbitrary number of images.

22
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:19,180
I strongly recommend that you take the time to do this yourself right now,

23
00:01:19,180 --> 00:01:21,440
rather than just restart the video.

24
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:23,450
But of course nobody's watching, so you can just

25
00:01:23,450 --> 00:01:26,300
restart the video if you want to.

26
00:01:26,300 --> 00:01:28,374
