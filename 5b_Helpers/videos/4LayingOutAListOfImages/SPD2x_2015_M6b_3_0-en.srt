00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,690

00:00:04,690 --> 00:00:08,050
GREGOR KICZALES: Now I'm going to complete the design of layout images.

2
00:00:08,050 --> 00:00:10,080
There's nothing really new in this function.

3
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:13,140
You know how to design at this point.

4
00:00:13,140 --> 00:00:16,257
But I suggest you follow along with me anyways.

5
00:00:16,257 --> 00:00:19,090
I think you might have heard me say once or twice that you can never

6
00:00:19,090 --> 00:00:21,870
get too much practice.

7
00:00:21,870 --> 00:00:25,260
Now I want to complete the design of layout images.

8
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:27,540
So the next thing I need to do is some check expects.

9
00:00:27,540 --> 00:00:30,070


10
00:00:30,070 --> 00:00:34,540
Check-expect (layout-images-- let's see.

11
00:00:34,540 --> 00:00:40,650
If you lay out the empty images, then that's just going to produce BLANK.

12
00:00:40,650 --> 00:00:46,050
And now we'll do one for layout-images of,

13
00:00:46,050 --> 00:00:49,870
let's see-- we can grab this example from up here.

14
00:00:49,870 --> 00:00:51,360
It's a perfectly good example.

15
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:52,105
It's too long.

16
00:00:52,105 --> 00:00:57,610


17
00:00:57,610 --> 00:00:59,980
In a minute, I'll use Command-I to fix the indentation.

18
00:00:59,980 --> 00:01:01,070
Let me just do that.

19
00:01:01,070 --> 00:01:02,526
Command-I fixes the indentation.

20
00:01:02,526 --> 00:01:05,290


21
00:01:05,290 --> 00:01:07,870
Layout-images-- well, what's that going to be?

22
00:01:07,870 --> 00:01:09,840
We kind of figured this out before, right?

23
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:24,780
It's beside of this rectangle, this rectangle, and BLANK.

24
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:31,560


25
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:32,430
I'll run that.

26
00:01:32,430 --> 00:01:33,760
The tests are well formed.

27
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:37,730
But now a number of tests are failing.

28
00:01:37,730 --> 00:01:39,000
I'll go get the template.

29
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:47,580


30
00:01:47,580 --> 00:01:48,950
I'll paste it in here.

31
00:01:48,950 --> 00:01:52,030


32
00:01:52,030 --> 00:01:54,000
I'll comment out the stub.

33
00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:01,625
I'll rename the template and the natural recursion.

34
00:02:01,625 --> 00:02:04,500


35
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:05,940
And now let's see.

36
00:02:05,940 --> 00:02:10,100
If I'm laying out a empty list of images, I produce BLANK.

37
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:13,510
And otherwise, I just put the first image

38
00:02:13,510 --> 00:02:18,461
beside the result of the natural recursion command.

39
00:02:18,461 --> 00:02:19,960
That actually fixes the indentation.

40
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:21,152
I run it.

41
00:02:21,152 --> 00:02:22,360
Let's see-- there's one test.

42
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:24,470
I have to be careful.

43
00:02:24,470 --> 00:02:27,500
Because now, one of the four tests are failing.

44
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:31,459
First thing I need to know-- is that a test on layout images?

45
00:02:31,459 --> 00:02:32,000
And it isn't.

46
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,540
I click on it, it's a test on a range images.

47
00:02:34,540 --> 00:02:39,610
So layout images is actually working properly now.

48
00:02:39,610 --> 00:02:43,740
Why is this test on a range images failing?

49
00:02:43,740 --> 00:02:47,250
Oh look, this other test isn't failing.

50
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:51,780
What's happening here is your range images test

51
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:56,040
where the list doesn't require sorting is working fine.

52
00:02:56,040 --> 00:03:00,740
Your range images test where the list does require sorting isn't working.

53
00:03:00,740 --> 00:03:05,760
And that's because of this stub we made for sort images that

54
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:08,520
just produces whatever it's given.

55
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:11,850
If you happen to call sort images with a list that's already sorting,

56
00:03:11,850 --> 00:03:13,920
it happens to work.

57
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:17,460
So that's why one of these cases of arrange images is working and one

58
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:18,472
isn't.

59
00:03:18,472 --> 00:03:20,430
This is going to start to happen more and more.

60
00:03:20,430 --> 00:03:24,420
As you get a big program with multiple stubs in it, some tests might work.

61
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:26,490
Some other test might not work.

62
00:03:26,490 --> 00:03:30,000
The key thing is, since I just finished layout images,

63
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,780
what I want to be sure is that those tests are passing.

64
00:03:32,780 --> 00:03:33,990
And they are.

65
00:03:33,990 --> 00:03:37,440
So layout images seems to be done now.

66
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:42,320
Going back to my overview diagram of where we are in the overall process,

67
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:48,640
range images is still done except it has uncompleted wish list entries.

68
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:51,070
The layout images wish list entries completely done.

69
00:03:51,070 --> 00:03:53,830
Layout images is done and tested.

70
00:03:53,830 --> 00:03:59,470
But sort images is still sitting there in stub form.

71
00:03:59,470 --> 00:04:02,460
That's what we're going to turn to the next video.

72
00:04:02,460 --> 00:04:03,529
