GREGOR KICZALES: The key to solving complex design problems is

2
00:00:07,220 --> 00:00:10,280
to break them down into smaller pieces.

3
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:13,320
Now, the recipes already do that, of course.

4
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:17,700
The data recipe breaks data design down into individual steps.

5
00:00:17,700 --> 00:00:22,370
The function recipe does the same and so does the world recipe.

6
00:00:22,370 --> 00:00:25,960
But sometimes we need more decomposition than that.

7
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:28,910
Sometimes we need to break a data representation

8
00:00:28,910 --> 00:00:34,250
into multiple types or a function design into multiple functions.

9
00:00:34,250 --> 00:00:37,600
Now, we've seen a couple examples of that already, of course.

10
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:40,560
Whenever we have the reference rule, then we

11
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:46,710
end up with a natural helper function, and the world's recipe also breaks

12
00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:50,500
the design down into multiple handlers.

13
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:53,770
But this week, we're going to look at more examples of how

14
00:00:53,770 --> 00:00:59,480
we break types and functions down into multiple types and multiple functions.
