GREGOR KICZALES: I'm going to end the week with our most elaborate world

2
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:09,970
program yet.

3
00:00:09,970 --> 00:00:13,170
What we saw earlier was that cats have a mind of their own.

4
00:00:13,170 --> 00:00:18,220
When they get to the edge of the box, they just keep walking off the screen.

5
00:00:18,220 --> 00:00:22,350
Cows, on the other hand, cows are a docile creature.

6
00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:27,330
When they get to the fence, they turn around and they go back the other way.

7
00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:30,320
So we're going to do a cow animation now.

8
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:33,840
And you can kind of see the key way it's going to be different, right?

9
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:35,690
A cat only has a position.

10
00:00:35,690 --> 00:00:38,390
It always goes the same direction.

11
00:00:38,390 --> 00:00:43,970
But a cow has two changing properties, its position and its direction.

12
00:00:43,970 --> 00:00:46,480
So this is going to be a compound data problem.

13
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:50,660
It's going to be a how to design a world's problem with compound data.

14
00:00:50,660 --> 00:00:51,790
This is a long video.

15
00:00:51,790 --> 00:00:55,350
You may not want to watch it all at one sitting.

16
00:00:55,350 --> 00:00:58,840
But a world problem is a long problem, and compound data

17
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:00,240
makes it a bit longer.

18
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:03,880
And there's a couple other interesting points that happen here along the way.

19
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:07,520
So I would encourage you to be sure to watch this whole video through.

20
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:10,590
Again, a good thing to do might be to stop it every now and then

21
00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:15,250
and try to work a bit of it on your own getting ahead of the video.

22
00:01:15,250 --> 00:01:18,950
But don't do that when you get to the render cow

23
00:01:18,950 --> 00:01:21,190
function because there's a special thing going

24
00:01:21,190 --> 00:01:23,130
on there that we need to talk about.

25
00:01:23,130 --> 00:01:26,840
What I have open here in DrRacket is the starter file.

26
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:29,430
We're also providing intermediate solutions

27
00:01:29,430 --> 00:01:33,610
at different points along the way of developing the whole solution.

28
00:01:33,610 --> 00:01:37,800
And as I said, I'll be dropping into different places in this as we go.

29
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:41,720
So here's the problem statement worked out in a bit more detail.

30
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:44,850
We're going to have a cow that walks back and forth across the screen,

31
00:01:44,850 --> 00:01:48,900
and when it gets to the edge it changes direction and goes back the other way.

32
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:50,880
And we're giving you a couple nice images

33
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:54,240
of cows, which we got from Brown.

34
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:59,240
Of course, with any world program, the first step is to do an analysis.

35
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:02,770
I have the analysis already worked out, and here it is.

36
00:02:02,770 --> 00:02:06,210
And mostly, it's like the analysis for the cat program.

37
00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:09,850
A lot of the constant information is the same-- the width, the height,

38
00:02:09,850 --> 00:02:12,500
the ctr-y, the background.

39
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:15,636
One difference is here the cow has two images, the image where

40
00:02:15,636 --> 00:02:18,510
it's facing to the right and the image where it's facing to the left.

41
00:02:18,510 --> 00:02:20,190
So that's one difference.

42
00:02:20,190 --> 00:02:23,140
The most important difference is reflected in the center picture

43
00:02:23,140 --> 00:02:25,450
and also in the changing information, which

44
00:02:25,450 --> 00:02:29,930
is that here there are two changing information values associated

45
00:02:29,930 --> 00:02:36,790
with the cow, the cow's x-coordinate and the cow's direction and speed.

46
00:02:36,790 --> 00:02:42,780
We're going to call the direction speed dx for the change in x.

47
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:45,680
So that is how we're going to label the velocity, which

48
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:49,010
is the change in the position.

49
00:02:49,010 --> 00:02:52,310
Another difference shows up here in the third image,

50
00:02:52,310 --> 00:02:54,550
where I've made a detailed note to myself

51
00:02:54,550 --> 00:02:58,340
describing what's going to happen when the cow gets to the edge.

52
00:02:58,340 --> 00:03:02,310
So what I'm saying here is that if the cow center, cow x,

53
00:03:02,310 --> 00:03:08,549
tries to go past width or past 0, then we're going to reset it.

54
00:03:08,549 --> 00:03:10,340
So here the decision I'm making is that I'm

55
00:03:10,340 --> 00:03:13,750
going to let the cow get all the way up to the edge of the box,

56
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:15,464
but not outside.

57
00:03:15,464 --> 00:03:17,630
The big-bang options are relatively straightforward.

58
00:03:17,630 --> 00:03:21,780
There's on-tick, to-draw, and on-key.

59
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:24,230
So now I'm going to jump to the v0 solution.

60
00:03:24,230 --> 00:03:27,240
And in all of these solution files, you can see a list

61
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:29,830
of kind of where each one is in it.

62
00:03:29,830 --> 00:03:33,949
You might choose not to read that so that you don't get too far ahead.

63
00:03:33,949 --> 00:03:36,240
What you might want to do now is try to do some of this

64
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:40,480
yourself and then use these solution files to catch yourself up,

65
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:45,100
or watch the video to catch yourself up, or follow along with me either way.

66
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:47,100
So look, here's the constants, and the constants

67
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:48,391
are relatively straightforward.

68
00:03:48,391 --> 00:03:50,410
There's the width, the height, the ctr-y.

69
00:03:50,410 --> 00:03:54,140
There's two cow images and the background.

70
00:03:54,140 --> 00:03:56,580
Nothing really new there.
