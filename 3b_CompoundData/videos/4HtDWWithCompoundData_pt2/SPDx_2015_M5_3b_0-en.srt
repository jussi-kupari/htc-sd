GREGOR KICZALES: Now I'm going to go on to the data definition for the changing

2
00:00:04,710 --> 00:00:06,210
world state.

3
00:00:06,210 --> 00:00:08,400
And looking at the analysis, I see that there's

4
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:12,830
two pieces of changing information, two changing information values

5
00:00:12,830 --> 00:00:14,320
that naturally belong together.

6
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:18,189
And so that tells me that I want to use a compound data definition.

7
00:00:18,189 --> 00:00:19,980
So when you use a compound data definition,

8
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:23,660
the first thing we have to do is a structure definition for it.

9
00:00:23,660 --> 00:00:28,480
So let me make a structure, and I guess I'll just call it cow.

10
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:29,820
And it has two fields.

11
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:34,110
And I'll call one x for the x-coordinate and one dx

12
00:00:34,110 --> 00:00:37,290
for the current rate of change in the x-coordinate.

13
00:00:37,290 --> 00:00:41,650
And I'll say cow is make cow.

14
00:00:41,650 --> 00:00:46,180
Now we know that this cow nicely stays in the box.

15
00:00:46,180 --> 00:00:48,720
So that means we know that the x-coordinate is bounded

16
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:51,820
a certain way in this world program.

17
00:00:51,820 --> 00:00:56,770
So what I'm going to do here is I'm going to say natural zero comma

18
00:00:56,770 --> 00:01:01,870
width as a way of saying that the cow's x-coordinate stays

19
00:01:01,870 --> 00:01:03,245
within the boundaries of the box.

20
00:01:03,245 --> 00:01:05,820


21
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:11,880
And we don't know any bounds on dx or on the velocity of the cow.

22
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:15,050
But let's just decide that it's going to be at least an integer.

23
00:01:15,050 --> 00:01:16,854
That'll make some other things simpler.

24
00:01:16,854 --> 00:01:18,395
So we'll say that this is an integer.

25
00:01:18,395 --> 00:01:23,430


26
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:27,050
We'll say the interpretation of a cow is that if you have a cow make cow

27
00:01:27,050 --> 00:01:37,850
with an x and dx, then that's a cow with x-coordinates x and velocity dx.

28
00:01:37,850 --> 00:01:42,300


29
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:46,320
We'll say that the x is the center of the cow.

30
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:50,500


31
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:55,320
We'll say that x is in screen coordinates, or pixels.

32
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:59,110


33
00:01:59,110 --> 00:02:03,110
And we'll say that dx is in pixels per tick.

34
00:02:03,110 --> 00:02:05,770


35
00:02:05,770 --> 00:02:08,990
So that if dx is 3, for example, that means that on each clock tick,

36
00:02:08,990 --> 00:02:13,450
the cow moves by three pixels or its x value gets bigger by three.

37
00:02:13,450 --> 00:02:15,950
And here we're going to start to see where some examples get

38
00:02:15,950 --> 00:02:16,920
a bit more interesting.

39
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:19,140
I'm going to make a couple of them.

40
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:20,730
Let's say C1.

41
00:02:20,730 --> 00:02:26,720
Let's say this is a cow that's current position is 10

42
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:29,870
and that its current dx is 3.

43
00:02:29,870 --> 00:02:33,940
And I'll just label this one to help me understand the interpretation.

44
00:02:33,940 --> 00:02:41,070
At position 10, moving left to right.

45
00:02:41,070 --> 00:02:42,050
And here's another one.

46
00:02:42,050 --> 00:02:49,010


47
00:02:49,010 --> 00:02:56,050
And this one is at 20, and it's moving the other way.

48
00:02:56,050 --> 00:02:59,075
So this is a case where as the data definition becomes more complicated,

49
00:02:59,075 --> 00:03:02,420
the examples become more useful to really understand

50
00:03:02,420 --> 00:03:05,690
how the data definition works and what the interpretation is.

51
00:03:05,690 --> 00:03:08,752
Now, of course, I have to do the template and template rules used.

52
00:03:08,752 --> 00:03:10,710
But what I'm going to do to speed this video up

53
00:03:10,710 --> 00:03:14,180
a little bit is I'm kind of going to pull the next stage of the roast out

54
00:03:14,180 --> 00:03:16,230
of the oven ready done.

55
00:03:16,230 --> 00:03:23,180
I'll go to Cowabunga V1, and it already has the complete data definition here,

56
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:28,260
everything that we just did plus the template and template rules used.

57
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:32,620
Next step is going to be to set up the main function and all of the wish list

58
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:35,297
entries for the Big Bang option handlers.

59
00:03:35,297 --> 00:03:37,130
And since that's straightforward, again, I'm

60
00:03:37,130 --> 00:03:41,600
going to jump ahead to go to Cowabunga V2 that has all that.

61
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:45,150
You might want to not do that and go ahead and develop that yourself

62
00:03:45,150 --> 00:03:47,300
as a way of checking your work.

63
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:49,980
I'm going to jump ahead now, though.
