GREGOR KICZALES: In this how to design data problem,

2
00:00:07,250 --> 00:00:12,690
the type comment is going to end up with a one of, but not all of the subclasses

3
00:00:12,690 --> 00:00:15,460
are going to be single distinct values.

4
00:00:15,460 --> 00:00:17,980
So this is what's going to be called an itemization,

5
00:00:17,980 --> 00:00:22,780
and it'll be the most complex form of data that we see this week.

6
00:00:22,780 --> 00:00:25,130
This is the problem in Countdown Starter.

7
00:00:25,130 --> 00:00:28,300
So what we're supposed to do here is design a data definition

8
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:31,530
to represent the current state of a New Year's Eve countdown.

9
00:00:31,530 --> 00:00:34,910
So this is something like the countdown ball in Times Square.

10
00:00:34,910 --> 00:00:38,380
And we're asked to design a data definition for that.

11
00:00:38,380 --> 00:00:41,280
As always, when we designed a definition the first thing

12
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:44,460
is to clearly identify the information in the problem domain

13
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:46,350
that we're trying to represent.

14
00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:50,750
And in this case, the problem statement makes that very clear to us.

15
00:00:50,750 --> 00:00:53,020
In particular, it makes it clear that the information

16
00:00:53,020 --> 00:00:55,600
falls into one of three categories.

17
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:59,160
The countdown hasn't started, it's from 10 to 1 seconds before midnight,

18
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:00,650
or it's complete.

19
00:01:00,650 --> 00:01:04,300
The previous problem we saw, the letter grade problem,

20
00:01:04,300 --> 00:01:06,710
also had three categories.

21
00:01:06,710 --> 00:01:09,960
But here the categories are different.

22
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:12,690
This first one is kind of distinct.

23
00:01:12,690 --> 00:01:17,440
The countdown hasn't started, that's a clear, distinct state.

24
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:22,600
But in this second category, there's not a single distinct value there.

25
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:25,350
There's 10, 9, 8, all the way to 1.

26
00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:28,250
So there's a number of different values there.

27
00:01:28,250 --> 00:01:33,200
And then in the third category, again there's a distinct state there,

28
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:34,800
the countdown is complete.

29
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:37,740
So this isn't going to be an enumeration.

30
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:40,850
This is going to be what's called an itemization, because there

31
00:01:40,850 --> 00:01:45,620
are two or more subclasses, at least one of which

32
00:01:45,620 --> 00:01:47,820
is not a single, distinct value.

33
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:50,090
This center one is not a single, distinct value.

34
00:01:50,090 --> 00:01:52,910
So that's going to be an itemization.

35
00:01:52,910 --> 00:01:56,120
And again, after this video is over, I encourage

36
00:01:56,120 --> 00:02:01,010
you go to the Design Recipes page, go to the How to Design Data page.

37
00:02:01,010 --> 00:02:03,680
This table would remind you that itemization

38
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:06,320
is what you need to use in a case like this,

39
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:08,729
and you can go ahead and read about the itemizations.

40
00:02:08,729 --> 00:02:13,620
Do that carefully after this video is over, or work through the problem now.

41
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:14,660
So let's see.

42
00:02:14,660 --> 00:02:17,330
We start with the Type Comment, as always.

43
00:02:17,330 --> 00:02:24,755
So we'll say that Countdown is one of-- and there's three subclasses.

44
00:02:24,755 --> 00:02:27,690


45
00:02:27,690 --> 00:02:30,980
And now we have to decide for each subclass how we'll represent that,

46
00:02:30,980 --> 00:02:33,340
what data will represent that.

47
00:02:33,340 --> 00:02:34,190
Well, lets see.

48
00:02:34,190 --> 00:02:38,230
If the countdown hasn't yet started, that's kind of a distinct state.

49
00:02:38,230 --> 00:02:42,090
So we could use any piece of atomic, distinct data to represent that.

50
00:02:42,090 --> 00:02:44,270
Let's just use False.

51
00:02:44,270 --> 00:02:47,150
We'll only use the Boolean value False, to represent

52
00:02:47,150 --> 00:02:50,970
that the countdown hasn't yet started.

53
00:02:50,970 --> 00:02:54,040
Now in the second subclass, let's just say

54
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:59,806
that that'll be a natural number, from 1 to 10 inclusive.

55
00:02:59,806 --> 00:03:04,900
And in the third case, we also need a distinct value there.

56
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:09,570
And we'll just use the string in this case, complete.

57
00:03:09,570 --> 00:03:13,830
So now we've got three distinct subclasses

58
00:03:13,830 --> 00:03:16,980
that correspond to the three distinct kinds of information that

59
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:18,892
need to be represented.

60
00:03:18,892 --> 00:03:22,180
And we'll do an interpretation here.

61
00:03:22,180 --> 00:03:24,430
And I'll use multiple lines for this interpretation.

62
00:03:24,430 --> 00:03:31,250
I'll say false means countdown has not yet started.

63
00:03:31,250 --> 00:03:40,555
Natural 1 to 10 means countdown is running, and how many seconds left.

64
00:03:40,555 --> 00:03:43,460


65
00:03:43,460 --> 00:03:51,370
And Complete means countdown is over.

66
00:03:51,370 --> 00:03:54,720
And if you want to you, you can indulge your inner Virgo

67
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:58,370
and make these line up nicely.

68
00:03:58,370 --> 00:04:01,940
And if you don't want to, you don't have to.

69
00:04:01,940 --> 00:04:04,400
There's the Type Comment and the Interpretation.

70
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:06,980
Now we need some examples.

71
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:14,610
So we might say, define Countdown 1 is-- now, I'll put a false here.

72
00:04:14,610 --> 00:04:16,810
It's an atomic distinct, so in some sense

73
00:04:16,810 --> 00:04:20,700
you might find that that example is not particularly illustrative.

74
00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:27,900
But maybe I'll have Countdown 2 is 10, and I could put a comma in here

75
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:31,600
if I want, just started running.

76
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:40,500
Define Countdown 3, almost over.

77
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:47,324
And define Countdown 4, complete.

78
00:04:47,324 --> 00:04:49,720
And that one's clear.
