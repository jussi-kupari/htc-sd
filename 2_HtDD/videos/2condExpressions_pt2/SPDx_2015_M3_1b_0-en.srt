GREGOR KICZALES: To look at the rules for evaluating cond, what I want to do

2
00:00:03,650 --> 00:00:06,380
is work with a slightly simpler example.

3
00:00:06,380 --> 00:00:09,770
So what I'm going to do is make a new tab.

4
00:00:09,770 --> 00:00:12,190
And here's my simpler example.

5
00:00:12,190 --> 00:00:15,120
And I'll do the usual thing about putting the evaluation

6
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:17,760
rules for cond off to the right here.

7
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:19,900
And now let's get going.

8
00:00:19,900 --> 00:00:22,170
We start evaluating and we see open paren cond,

9
00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:27,500
so this is a cond expression, and we have to use the rules for cond.

10
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:29,350
There are question answer pairs.

11
00:00:29,350 --> 00:00:31,200
So there's no error.

12
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:31,920
And let's see.

13
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:35,960
The first question right here is not a value.

14
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:37,810
It's an expression.

15
00:00:37,810 --> 00:00:40,004
So we need to evaluate it.

16
00:00:40,004 --> 00:00:40,670
Well, let's see.

17
00:00:40,670 --> 00:00:43,150
Evaluating it, it's open paren greater-than.

18
00:00:43,150 --> 00:00:44,300
It's a call to a primitive.

19
00:00:44,300 --> 00:00:47,720
So we would use the call to a primitive rule.

20
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:51,690
Both operands are already values, so we can apply the primitive directly.

21
00:00:51,690 --> 00:00:55,800
So this greater-than 1 2 is going to produce false.

22
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:59,860
So what we're going to do is replace the entire cond

23
00:00:59,860 --> 00:01:08,810
with a cond in which the first question is false.

24
00:01:08,810 --> 00:01:10,060
Now we start evaluating again.

25
00:01:10,060 --> 00:01:12,541
Open paren cond, it's a cond.

26
00:01:12,541 --> 00:01:13,040
Let's see.

27
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:14,450
The first question is false.

28
00:01:14,450 --> 00:01:18,440
So that takes us to the if the first question is false rule.

29
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:22,700
And what that rule wants to do is drop the first question answer pair.

30
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:27,820
So what we get now is a new cond in which this first question answer

31
00:01:27,820 --> 00:01:31,440
pair is going to be deleted entirely.

32
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:35,940
I'm going to do command-e now to get myself more room here.

33
00:01:35,940 --> 00:01:36,440
OK.

34
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:36,940
Let's see.

35
00:01:36,940 --> 00:01:38,510
Open paren cond.

36
00:01:38,510 --> 00:01:40,100
There are question answer pairs.

37
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:43,220
The first question is not a value, it's an expression.

38
00:01:43,220 --> 00:01:46,920
So I need to evaluate the first question and replace the question

39
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:48,640
with its value.

40
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:52,700
Well, we know how to do that now.

41
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:57,830
That just gives me false again.

42
00:01:57,830 --> 00:02:00,540
Open paren cond, there are question answer pairs.

43
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:04,300
The first question is false.

44
00:02:04,300 --> 00:02:07,230
So again, it's the drop the first question rule.

45
00:02:07,230 --> 00:02:11,230


46
00:02:11,230 --> 00:02:13,135
We basically drop the first question.

47
00:02:13,135 --> 00:02:16,670


48
00:02:16,670 --> 00:02:18,440
Open paren cond.

49
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:20,580
There are questions.

50
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:24,670
The first question is not a value, is an expression.

51
00:02:24,670 --> 00:02:26,567
I evaluate it.

52
00:02:26,567 --> 00:02:28,650
We're getting there, we're getting very close now.

53
00:02:28,650 --> 00:02:32,040


54
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:35,360
That is now true.

55
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:38,330
Open paren cond, the first question is true.

56
00:02:38,330 --> 00:02:46,120
Now I replace the entire cond with the first answer expression.

57
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:46,760
OK, let's see.

58
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:47,551
What do I have now?

59
00:02:47,551 --> 00:02:50,620
Oh I have a value, I'm done evaluating.

60
00:02:50,620 --> 00:02:54,540
The key intuition is that the way the evaluation of cond works is it

61
00:02:54,540 --> 00:02:56,920
evaluates the first question.

62
00:02:56,920 --> 00:03:01,180
If it's false, it drops that question answer pair and starts over.

63
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:05,520
If the first question is true, then it replaces the entire cond

64
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:08,922
with the first answer.

65
00:03:08,922 --> 00:03:10,880
You can see here an interesting pattern, right?

66
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:13,250
Which is the rule for cond, the rule for function

67
00:03:13,250 --> 00:03:16,620
call, the rule for if, they all work in the same way.

68
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:21,090
They in some sense try to do their thing and then get out of the way.

69
00:03:21,090 --> 00:03:26,090
Right here in this last step with cond, once we got to the answer,

70
00:03:26,090 --> 00:03:27,922
the cond was gone.

71
00:03:27,922 --> 00:03:30,380
And that's the same thing that happened with function call.

72
00:03:30,380 --> 00:03:33,150
Once the body of the function is replaced in,

73
00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:36,420
the function call itself is gone.

74
00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:38,870
These style evaluation rules work that way.

75
00:03:38,870 --> 00:03:42,490
The idea is to take care of the more sophisticated construct

76
00:03:42,490 --> 00:03:45,360
and then get it out of the program.

77
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:45,860
OK.

78
00:03:45,860 --> 00:03:48,432
Here's another example for you to do stepping.

79
00:03:48,432 --> 00:03:49,890
It's a little bit more complicated.

80
00:03:49,890 --> 00:03:51,910
I apologize for all these stepping examples,

81
00:03:51,910 --> 00:03:56,530
but we know they really help people in terms of mastering how language works.

82
00:03:56,530 --> 00:04:00,490
And that really starts to help as the programs get more complicated.

83
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:04,060
So here's another example of that as an exercise.

84
00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:08,380
But it'll be interactive so that you can work through it as you go.

85
00:04:08,380 --> 00:04:10,172
