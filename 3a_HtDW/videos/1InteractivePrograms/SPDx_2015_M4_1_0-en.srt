00:00:04,470 --> 00:00:06,710
GREGOR KICZALES: We've covered quite a lot so far.

2
00:00:06,710 --> 00:00:09,360
You've learned about different forms of primitive data

3
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:12,030
like numbers and strings and images.

4
00:00:12,030 --> 00:00:15,100
You've learned about expressions like if and cond,

5
00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:21,210
how to define functions and constants, the rules for evaluating BSL code.

6
00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:23,640
We've also learned how to design functions recipe,

7
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:29,230
and how to design data recipe, and how to use the data-driven template rules.

8
00:00:29,230 --> 00:00:31,820
Really quite a lot.

9
00:00:31,820 --> 00:00:35,580
But you've had to be a certain kind of patient

10
00:00:35,580 --> 00:00:39,040
because the programs we've written so far have been kind of boring.

11
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:43,370
A function that consumes a seat number and tells you whether it's on the aisle

12
00:00:43,370 --> 00:00:46,880
might be useful as part of a big system, but the function itself

13
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:49,370
isn't very exciting.

14
00:00:49,370 --> 00:00:51,080
That's going to change this week.

15
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:54,920
This week we're going to start to get into interactive programs.

16
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:58,070
So I mean things like animations, and games,

17
00:00:58,070 --> 00:01:01,680
and the kind of desktop applications that you might use every day.

18
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:05,550
Now, I want to stress something about the way our programs are going to look.

19
00:01:05,550 --> 00:01:09,110
Here, for example, is a fireworks program we might design.

20
00:01:09,110 --> 00:01:12,530
And what I'm doing is I'm shooting off a bunch of fireworks,

21
00:01:12,530 --> 00:01:18,590
and they rise into the sky and explode beautifully like that.

22
00:01:18,590 --> 00:01:21,990
Now, the graphic quality there isn't fantastic.

23
00:01:21,990 --> 00:01:26,660
It's not Harry Potter Deathly Hallows fantastic.

24
00:01:26,660 --> 00:01:31,030
That's the way our programs are going to look this week because graphic quality

25
00:01:31,030 --> 00:01:34,010
is something that requires a great deal of math sophistication

26
00:01:34,010 --> 00:01:37,060
and a great deal of programming power.

27
00:01:37,060 --> 00:01:39,880
So we're going to have simple graphics.

28
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:42,810
But the basic structure of our programs, the basic structure

29
00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:46,440
of our animations and games and desktop applications,

30
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:48,740
is really going to be like the same structure

31
00:01:48,740 --> 00:01:51,440
of the more sophisticated versions.

32
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:55,230
So by the end of this week, you'll be able to design interactive programs,

33
00:01:55,230 --> 00:01:57,970
and I think you'll also have a better understanding of how

34
00:01:57,970 --> 00:02:01,880
some of the programs that you use every day work.

35
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:05,970
In fact, project 1, which you'll start at the end of this week,

36
00:02:05,970 --> 00:02:10,150
is to complete the design of a simple one-line text editor,

37
00:02:10,150 --> 00:02:12,640
kind of like the text editor you use on your phone

38
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:15,150
when you want to send a text message.

39
00:02:15,150 --> 00:02:16,045
