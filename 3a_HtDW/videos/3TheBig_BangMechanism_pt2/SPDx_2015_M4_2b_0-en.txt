GREGOR KICZALES: Looking back at our table,
we see that at each clock tick what happens
is that the representation of the cat's x-coordinate increases by its speed
each time.
So it goes from 0 to 3 to 6 to 9.
So here's a function that does that for us.
It signature is cat to cat.
So it takes a cat and produces a cat, and it increases that position
by the cat's speed.
And there's some check expects.
And if we look at the body of the function, we can see what we expect.
It takes the current x-coordinate of the cat and increases it by speed.
