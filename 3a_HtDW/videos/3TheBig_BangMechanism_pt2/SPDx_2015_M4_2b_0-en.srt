GREGOR KICZALES: Looking back at our table,

2
00:00:02,790 --> 00:00:05,140
we see that at each clock tick what happens

3
00:00:05,140 --> 00:00:10,520
is that the representation of the cat's x-coordinate increases by its speed

4
00:00:10,520 --> 00:00:11,040
each time.

5
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:14,200
So it goes from 0 to 3 to 6 to 9.

6
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:16,690
So here's a function that does that for us.

7
00:00:16,690 --> 00:00:18,130
It signature is cat to cat.

8
00:00:18,130 --> 00:00:22,440
So it takes a cat and produces a cat, and it increases that position

9
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:24,700
by the cat's speed.

10
00:00:24,700 --> 00:00:26,660
And there's some check expects.

11
00:00:26,660 --> 00:00:29,680
And if we look at the body of the function, we can see what we expect.

12
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:36,150
It takes the current x-coordinate of the cat and increases it by speed.
