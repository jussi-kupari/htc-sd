GREGOR KICZALES: So far we've done quite a lot.

2
00:00:07,190 --> 00:00:11,300
We looked at primitive data and primitive operations on that data.

3
00:00:11,300 --> 00:00:13,920
You learned the How to Design Functions recipe, and the

4
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:16,079
How to Design Data recipe.

5
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:19,890
And you also learned the How to Design Worlds recipe for designing world

6
00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:23,670
programs, like animations and games.

7
00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:26,460
Most recently, we looked at compound data

8
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:31,210
and learned how to use that in world programs.

9
00:00:31,210 --> 00:00:35,270
But so far all of the data definitions we've worked with

10
00:00:35,270 --> 00:00:37,950
have been what's called fixed-size.

11
00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:41,170
And this week we're going to add to our repertoire,

12
00:00:41,170 --> 00:00:44,630
working with arbitrary sized data.

13
00:00:44,630 --> 00:00:47,350
And what do I mean by arbitrary sized data?

14
00:00:47,350 --> 00:00:51,040
I mean, the kind of data we use when we want to represent

15
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:53,110
an unknown amount of information.

16
00:00:53,110 --> 00:00:57,070
Information that we don't know upfront how much there will be.

17
00:00:57,070 --> 00:01:01,330
So for example, if we want to represent all of someone's favorite hockey teams,

18
00:01:01,330 --> 00:01:05,860
or all the students in a course, we just don't know how many of those

19
00:01:05,860 --> 00:01:07,320
there will be upfront.

20
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:11,480
And that's what we need arbitrary sized data for.

21
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:14,120
So that's what we're going to work with this week.

22
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:16,380
We'll look at how to do the data definitions.

23
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:21,400
And we'll look at the effect that has on functions we design on that data.
