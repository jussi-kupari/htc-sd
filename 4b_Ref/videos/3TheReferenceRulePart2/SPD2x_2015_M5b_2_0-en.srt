GREGOR KICZALES: In this middle part of the tuition graphing problem,

2
00:00:07,510 --> 00:00:11,700
nothing fundamentally new is going to happen, but something super important

3
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:13,850
is going to happen anyways.

4
00:00:13,850 --> 00:00:18,220
This video is really going to show the importance of doing examples

5
00:00:18,220 --> 00:00:20,670
before the function definition.

6
00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:24,570
In this video, what we want is complicated enough

7
00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:30,000
that I'm going to spend quite a lot of time just getting the examples right.

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,700
And once I do that, the function definition itself will be a lot easier.

9
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:39,900
So this is a demonstration of the power of the way the method puts examples

10
00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:42,390
before function definitions.

11
00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:46,320
Now I'm in tuition graph v3, and that has the complete data definitions

12
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:49,280
for both school and ListofSchool.

13
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:53,712
And now it's time to go design the first of the functions.

14
00:00:53,712 --> 00:00:55,420
So remember, what we're supposed to do is

15
00:00:55,420 --> 00:00:58,630
to design a function that consumes information about schools.

16
00:00:58,630 --> 00:01:03,390
In other words, it consumes a value of type ListofSchool,

17
00:01:03,390 --> 00:01:06,782
and it's got to produce a bar chart kind of like this one.

18
00:01:06,782 --> 00:01:08,490
So what I'm going to do in order to avoid

19
00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:11,560
scrolling so much, because scrolling makes people seasick,

20
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:16,190
I know, is I'm just going to copy that and bring it

21
00:01:16,190 --> 00:01:18,417
all the way down here to my functions part,

22
00:01:18,417 --> 00:01:20,250
and I'll just stick it in a comment for now.

23
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:23,990
It's just to remind us what we're trying to do.

24
00:01:23,990 --> 00:01:26,590
So let's see, we're designing a function.

25
00:01:26,590 --> 00:01:31,950
It consumes ListofSchool, and it's going to produce an image like that.

26
00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:35,460
So that's what that has to do.

27
00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:45,160
And let's see, produce bar chart showing names and tuitions

28
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:49,070
of the consumed schools.

29
00:01:49,070 --> 00:01:50,200
Let's do a stub.

30
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:59,200
Define-- we'll call it chart, and it consumes a list of school.

31
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:07,620
And what I use for the stub for functions that produce image is this.

32
00:02:07,620 --> 00:02:10,669


33
00:02:10,669 --> 00:02:14,180
White, there we go.

34
00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:14,680
Great.

35
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:18,000
The stub is well-formed.

36
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,560
Now let's try to do some examples.

37
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:23,210
Well, it's a function operating on a list.

38
00:02:23,210 --> 00:02:26,190
It's a function operating on a self-referential data definition.

39
00:02:26,190 --> 00:02:28,164
So the base case test should be first.

40
00:02:28,164 --> 00:02:31,070


41
00:02:31,070 --> 00:02:35,700
So what are you supposed to produce if I hand you an empty list of schools?

42
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:38,410
Well, you've got to produce an image.

43
00:02:38,410 --> 00:02:46,130
So I'm going to produce this same dummy value that the stub happens to produce,

44
00:02:46,130 --> 00:02:49,790
and that'll be the base case result.

45
00:02:49,790 --> 00:02:51,170
Let's do another example.

46
00:02:51,170 --> 00:02:53,400
Let's say check-expect.

47
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:57,780
Now, the rule is two long, so let's go ahead and do one that's two long.

48
00:02:57,780 --> 00:02:59,847
Check-expect chart.

49
00:02:59,847 --> 00:03:00,430
You know what?

50
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:03,200
Let's do one that's one long first.

51
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:06,550
It's tempting to do the two long one, but let's do the one long one first.

52
00:03:06,550 --> 00:03:08,990
It'll be simpler.

53
00:03:08,990 --> 00:03:10,850
Chart columns.

54
00:03:10,850 --> 00:03:13,120
And now we need some school.

55
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:15,130
Make-school.

56
00:03:15,130 --> 00:03:18,320
You can use any name you want.

57
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:22,460
We'll just call it S1 for now because it'll be simple.

58
00:03:22,460 --> 00:03:29,230
Make a school called S1 in which the tuition is-- I don't know, 999.

59
00:03:29,230 --> 00:03:31,800
OK?

60
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:33,910
Let's not make it 999.

61
00:03:33,910 --> 00:03:41,030
Let's make it some nice more round number than that, like 800.

62
00:03:41,030 --> 00:03:45,690
Just keeping things easy to work with here, easy, not cute.

63
00:03:45,690 --> 00:03:50,346
So if I've got to chart that, then what do I want to see?

64
00:03:50,346 --> 00:03:52,520
Hmm.

65
00:03:52,520 --> 00:04:00,350
Well, I know that the base case result is this.

66
00:04:00,350 --> 00:04:08,750


67
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:13,590
The question is, what's the contribution of this one school here?

68
00:04:13,590 --> 00:04:14,090
Hmm.

69
00:04:14,090 --> 00:04:15,298
Well, let's think about that.

70
00:04:15,298 --> 00:04:17,190
What is the contribution of that?

71
00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:21,529
Well, we want to see that text.

72
00:04:21,529 --> 00:04:23,750
That's for sure.

73
00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:24,250
Whoops.

74
00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:26,700
Remember, there's that function text.

75
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:32,420
We want to see the text of S1, the name of the school.

76
00:04:32,420 --> 00:04:34,770
And how big do we want the text to be?

77
00:04:34,770 --> 00:04:40,090
Well, you might remember that there was a constant up here, FONT-SIZE,

78
00:04:40,090 --> 00:04:40,605
that I used.

79
00:04:40,605 --> 00:04:45,650


80
00:04:45,650 --> 00:04:49,400
So let me say that it's of size FONT-SIZE.

81
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:51,535
And there's another constant, FONT-COLOR.

82
00:04:51,535 --> 00:04:54,700


83
00:04:54,700 --> 00:04:58,790
So that's going to get me the name S1.

84
00:04:58,790 --> 00:05:01,230
But let's see here.

85
00:05:01,230 --> 00:05:03,640
That's going to give it to me horizontally,

86
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:08,440
and I want this to be vertically.

87
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:10,680
So I need to rotate that.

88
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:12,185
So let me rotate it.

89
00:05:12,185 --> 00:05:14,920


90
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:17,040
I need to rotate it that way.

91
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:19,770
I can never remember which way the rotation is.

92
00:05:19,770 --> 00:05:23,120
I'll say minus 90.

93
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:25,020
But see, that gets me part of it.

94
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:28,381
That gets me just the text.

95
00:05:28,381 --> 00:05:30,380
And I've got to put them all next to each other,

96
00:05:30,380 --> 00:05:34,791
so it seems like there's a beside here.

97
00:05:34,791 --> 00:05:36,040
Now let me show you something.

98
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:41,760
I know I'm not done yet, but I'm going to run this anyways.

99
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:44,430
And that first test passed.

100
00:05:44,430 --> 00:05:48,090
This test failed because rotate expects an angle

101
00:05:48,090 --> 00:05:51,110
in degrees as its first argument.

102
00:05:51,110 --> 00:05:54,860
Oh, I've got the arguments in the wrong order.

103
00:05:54,860 --> 00:05:55,985
So I'll put this over here.

104
00:05:55,985 --> 00:05:59,840


105
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:04,810
What I wanted to show you there is as examples become more complicated,

106
00:06:04,810 --> 00:06:07,930
and especially once they involve images, you

107
00:06:07,930 --> 00:06:09,920
can go ahead and run them even before they're

108
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:13,450
complete just to see if the part you have makes sense.

109
00:06:13,450 --> 00:06:16,950
You'll catch errors like wrong order of arguments to rotate.

110
00:06:16,950 --> 00:06:18,810
Catch them right now.

111
00:06:18,810 --> 00:06:21,690
Finding a mistake right after you make it is easier

112
00:06:21,690 --> 00:06:23,610
than finding it five minutes later.

113
00:06:23,610 --> 00:06:25,650
So that's why I ran that then.

114
00:06:25,650 --> 00:06:28,280
Let's run it again.

115
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:30,070
The test is failing, which we expected.

116
00:06:30,070 --> 00:06:32,320
But let's just take a look at what the image is to see

117
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:36,550
if it's starting to look right for us.

118
00:06:36,550 --> 00:06:38,180
Well, I've got S1.

119
00:06:38,180 --> 00:06:39,260
That part's not bad.

120
00:06:39,260 --> 00:06:40,750
But it's rotated the wrong way.

121
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:43,670
That's what I was almost guaranteed to get wrong was

122
00:06:43,670 --> 00:06:47,070
the direction of the rotation.

123
00:06:47,070 --> 00:06:47,749
All right.

124
00:06:47,749 --> 00:06:49,040
That's starting to look better.

125
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:53,800
But that's just getting me the S.

126
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:58,730
Now, remember, remember, remember, remember, this little box around here

127
00:06:58,730 --> 00:07:03,620
is not actually part of my result. This box is put here by the test window.

128
00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:08,380
See how the test window puts a box there and a box there around the base result?

129
00:07:08,380 --> 00:07:11,790
That box is not actually part of my result.

130
00:07:11,790 --> 00:07:13,250
So there's something missing here.

131
00:07:13,250 --> 00:07:16,555
One is that I want that color bar and the other is that I want that box.

132
00:07:16,555 --> 00:07:19,165


133
00:07:19,165 --> 00:07:20,510
Let's see.

134
00:07:20,510 --> 00:07:22,311
Let's try to make the color bar.

135
00:07:22,311 --> 00:07:26,730


136
00:07:26,730 --> 00:07:29,090
Now see, this is putting that next to that.

137
00:07:29,090 --> 00:07:35,760
It seems like what I also need is to put the color bar.

138
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:38,075
So that's going to be something like rectangle.

139
00:07:38,075 --> 00:07:40,870


140
00:07:40,870 --> 00:07:42,230
And how wide is it?

141
00:07:42,230 --> 00:07:54,820
Well, I have a constant for that-- BAR-WIDTH, BAR-WIDTH.

142
00:07:54,820 --> 00:07:57,500
And it's going to be some fraction of 800.

143
00:07:57,500 --> 00:08:03,770
Remember, I have that thing called Y-SCALE?

144
00:08:03,770 --> 00:08:08,830
What I'm going to do is I'm going to multiply 800 times the Y-SCALE.

145
00:08:08,830 --> 00:08:11,630


146
00:08:11,630 --> 00:08:14,051
That gets me the bar height.

147
00:08:14,051 --> 00:08:19,840
And then there's the BAR-COLOR, and I want that to be solid.

148
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:25,320
So now I've got the text and the bar, but I need to line those up.

149
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:28,820
Now, here's a thing you probably wouldn't have remembered.

150
00:08:28,820 --> 00:08:32,120
But there's a primitive, very useful here,

151
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:38,909
called overlay dash align center bottom.

152
00:08:38,909 --> 00:08:41,840


153
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:49,850
And that's going to put that color bar and that text lined up, I think,

154
00:08:49,850 --> 00:08:50,410
nicely.

155
00:08:50,410 --> 00:08:51,322
Let's try it.

156
00:08:51,322 --> 00:08:54,520


157
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:57,930
Rectangle expects mode as a third argument.

158
00:08:57,930 --> 00:08:59,680
Oh, I've got them in the wrong order here.

159
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:05,356


160
00:09:05,356 --> 00:09:07,668
What do we got?

161
00:09:07,668 --> 00:09:10,350
Hmm.

162
00:09:10,350 --> 00:09:12,408
The color bar isn't very high, is it?

163
00:09:12,408 --> 00:09:16,280


164
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:19,150
I'm multiplying 800 times the Y-SCALE.

165
00:09:19,150 --> 00:09:22,400


166
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:25,740
Oh, 800 isn't a very high tuition.

167
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:27,510
8,000 is a higher tuition.

168
00:09:27,510 --> 00:09:30,840
Let's use 8,000.

169
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:31,340
Try that.

170
00:09:31,340 --> 00:09:34,800


171
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:36,560
Now we're almost there.

172
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:39,260
This is almost like what we have here, except there's

173
00:09:39,260 --> 00:09:42,860
no black box around the color bar.

174
00:09:42,860 --> 00:09:46,200
So let me add a black box too.

175
00:09:46,200 --> 00:10:00,240
We'll say rectangle BAR-WIDTH times 800 Y-SCALE-- oh, not 800, 8,000.

176
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:04,040
800's a pretty good deal for tuition.

177
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:11,250
Outline black, and that's going to be that outline there.

178
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:14,900
Now let's see what we got.

179
00:10:14,900 --> 00:10:16,080
Hey, that's looking better.

180
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:20,500
That does look like one of the bars that we're interested in.

181
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:23,200


182
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:26,520
Now, notice something very, very important here.

183
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:28,450
That was kind of complicated.

184
00:10:28,450 --> 00:10:32,250
In fact, you may not feel comfortable with it yet.

185
00:10:32,250 --> 00:10:34,850
And if you don't feel comfortable with it, what I would do

186
00:10:34,850 --> 00:10:37,210
is stop the video right here and replay it.

187
00:10:37,210 --> 00:10:41,350
Let me read it through first, and then replay it.

188
00:10:41,350 --> 00:10:45,680
All it's saying is it's saying, listen, in order to make one bar,

189
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:50,060
take three things and align their bottom centers.

190
00:10:50,060 --> 00:10:52,960
That's what's getting everything shifted to the bottom here.

191
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:59,630
Align their bottom centers so that it says

192
00:10:59,630 --> 00:11:02,420
the text-- that's the name of the school--

193
00:11:02,420 --> 00:11:08,920
a black outline of the right size, in other words, BAR-WIDTH, and then

194
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:13,430
the tuition times the scaling factor, and then the actual color

195
00:11:13,430 --> 00:11:17,910
text, BAR-WIDTH, and then the tuition times the scaling factor.

196
00:11:17,910 --> 00:11:23,740
And this whole thing here is producing just the one bar.

197
00:11:23,740 --> 00:11:26,820
And what this is saying is it's saying, oh, well,

198
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:31,950
put all of that next to the base case result. So that's one check-expect.

199
00:11:31,950 --> 00:11:34,920


200
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:39,680
That was so hard to produce that for the second example, for the times

201
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:44,160
two example, what I'm going to do is I'm going

202
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:49,470
to make the second school be S2, except it's going to come first in the list.

203
00:11:49,470 --> 00:12:00,110
And then that's going to be cons-ed onto make-school S1, the original example,

204
00:12:00,110 --> 00:12:04,090
8,000, which will be cons-ed onto empty.

205
00:12:04,090 --> 00:12:06,200
So now I've got a list that's two long.

206
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:08,960
The second school in the list is the one we had before.

207
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:11,460
The first school in the list is the new one.

208
00:12:11,460 --> 00:12:16,780
And I'm just going to take this value here and adjust it to be what I want.

209
00:12:16,780 --> 00:12:20,740


210
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:29,350
So this school is called S2, and 12,000 is its tuition.

211
00:12:29,350 --> 00:12:32,630
And now let's look at that.

212
00:12:32,630 --> 00:12:33,660
Two tests are failing.

213
00:12:33,660 --> 00:12:35,050
That's what we'd expect.

214
00:12:35,050 --> 00:12:37,990
But they're really starting to look right now.

215
00:12:37,990 --> 00:12:40,300
Oh, wait, that didn't align properly.

216
00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:43,010
That floated up.

217
00:12:43,010 --> 00:12:43,960
Oh, yeah.

218
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:47,650
Because remember, that's why we had to use--

219
00:12:47,650 --> 00:12:52,910
we used overlay align because we wanted to get the individual components

220
00:12:52,910 --> 00:12:55,110
of the bar to be lined up right.

221
00:12:55,110 --> 00:12:57,260
But beside isn't good enough either.

222
00:12:57,260 --> 00:13:02,452
We need to use beside slash align bottom.

223
00:13:02,452 --> 00:13:06,680


224
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:12,625
And here we'll use beside slash align bottom.

225
00:13:12,625 --> 00:13:25,510


226
00:13:25,510 --> 00:13:26,790
Now it's looking better.

227
00:13:26,790 --> 00:13:29,350


228
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:31,840
In previous weeks, people sometimes were like, I

229
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:36,110
don't understand why we do the examples before we do the function.

230
00:13:36,110 --> 00:13:40,280
Here is why we do the examples before we do the function right here.

231
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:46,720
This problem is hard enough that figuring out specific examples

232
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:48,540
takes time.

233
00:13:48,540 --> 00:13:50,610
We got to figure out how we want to draw.

234
00:13:50,610 --> 00:13:52,790
Gee, we didn't use the right drawing function.

235
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:55,490
Gee, we got the wrong order of arguments to this function.

236
00:13:55,490 --> 00:14:00,097
There's a whole bunch of stuff we had to figure out for the specific examples.

237
00:14:00,097 --> 00:14:01,930
Trying to write the general-purpose function

238
00:14:01,930 --> 00:14:05,310
is always harder than writing a specific example.

239
00:14:05,310 --> 00:14:08,360
So if you're working on a problem where the specific examples are hard,

240
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:11,710
it's just crazy to try to write the general-purpose function first.

241
00:14:11,710 --> 00:14:16,080
The whole idea of this "doing the examples first" method

242
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:18,100
is do the simplest things first.

243
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:22,810
Because in hard problems, even the simplest things aren't that simple.

244
00:14:22,810 --> 00:14:25,310
So here is why we're doing the examples first.

245
00:14:25,310 --> 00:14:28,670
Because these examples are a little bit complicated.

246
00:14:28,670 --> 00:14:31,710
The examples force us to figure out what it

247
00:14:31,710 --> 00:14:35,840
is we really want-- exactly how we want things to line up,

248
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:40,050
exactly how we want things to look, what it is we really want.

249
00:14:40,050 --> 00:14:43,570
And once we know what we really want, coding the function definition

250
00:14:43,570 --> 00:14:45,177
is a lot easier.

251
00:14:45,177 --> 00:14:45,677
