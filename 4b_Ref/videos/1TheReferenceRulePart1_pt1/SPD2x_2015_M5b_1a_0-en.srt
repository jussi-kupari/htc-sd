GREGOR KICZALES: In the next few videos, we're

2
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:10,450
going to look at a more complex form of data than we've seen before.

3
00:00:10,450 --> 00:00:13,370
This data involves something called reference,

4
00:00:13,370 --> 00:00:17,790
and it comes up when the information we're trying to represent naturally

5
00:00:17,790 --> 00:00:21,226
has different related parts.

6
00:00:21,226 --> 00:00:24,100
Now that only happens in problems that are more complex than the ones

7
00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:28,130
we've seen so far, so in order to motivate this,

8
00:00:28,130 --> 00:00:31,530
I have to be working on a more complex problem and a problem that

9
00:00:31,530 --> 00:00:34,890
will take several videos to solve.

10
00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:38,550
Now of course when I do that, there'll be parts of this problem-- a number

11
00:00:38,550 --> 00:00:41,440
of parts of this problem-- that are quite familiar,

12
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:45,180
that only take things that we've seen before.

13
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:50,120
So as always, when that's the situation, that's a good place to stop the video

14
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:51,880
and work ahead.

15
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:54,610
In fact, to really encourage that this time,

16
00:00:54,610 --> 00:01:00,050
there'll be pauses in the video-- breaks in the video-- where I jump ahead.

17
00:01:00,050 --> 00:01:02,050
I won't actually work through some of the stuff

18
00:01:02,050 --> 00:01:04,340
that you've seen now many times before.

19
00:01:04,340 --> 00:01:07,360
That's a place for you to do that yourself and then see

20
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:10,890
where you are when the video restarts.

21
00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:13,592
OK, the problem is in Tuition Graph Starter.

22
00:01:13,592 --> 00:01:15,300
What's going on here is that we're trying

23
00:01:15,300 --> 00:01:18,880
to design a program that can produce bar charts

24
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:20,599
of different kinds of information.

25
00:01:20,599 --> 00:01:22,390
The way I've got the problem set up is it's

26
00:01:22,390 --> 00:01:25,730
supposed to produce a bar chart of tuition information

27
00:01:25,730 --> 00:01:28,890
for an arbitrary number of schools.

28
00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:32,140
We're saying that Eva has to decide where to go to university,

29
00:01:32,140 --> 00:01:34,590
and she wants to make a plot of the different tuition

30
00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:36,880
costs for universities.

31
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:38,520
So it's a three part problem.

32
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:40,920
First, we have to design a data definition

33
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:45,390
to represent the information about the tuition of the different universities.

34
00:01:45,390 --> 00:01:49,920
Then we have to design a function that's going to consume a list like that

35
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:52,367
and produce a bar chart like this one here.

36
00:01:52,367 --> 00:01:54,200
Finally, we have to design a function that's

37
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:56,770
going to consume a list of tuition information

38
00:01:56,770 --> 00:01:58,870
at the different universities and produce

39
00:01:58,870 --> 00:02:01,410
the school that has the lowest tuition.

40
00:02:01,410 --> 00:02:05,140
What I'm going to do now is that even though this isn't a world program,

41
00:02:05,140 --> 00:02:07,260
I can see that there's some constants here

42
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:10,750
related to the drawing-- things like the color of the bars

43
00:02:10,750 --> 00:02:12,972
and the size of the font.

44
00:02:12,972 --> 00:02:15,180
And so I'm going to do a little bit constant analysis

45
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:17,490
and define some constants now.

46
00:02:17,490 --> 00:02:20,070
So why don't you stop the video, and you do that too?

47
00:02:20,070 --> 00:02:22,580
And when you're done, restart the video, and you can compare

48
00:02:22,580 --> 00:02:24,925
what you've done to what I've done.

49
00:02:24,925 --> 00:02:25,425
