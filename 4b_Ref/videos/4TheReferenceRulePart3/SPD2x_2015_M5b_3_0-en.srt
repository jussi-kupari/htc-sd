GREGOR KICZALES: In this last video on the bar chart problem,

2
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:11,280
we're going to start by coding the body of the chart function.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,690
We're very quickly going to run into the natural helper in the template

4
00:00:15,690 --> 00:00:20,534
and that's going to force us to split the chart function into two functions.

5
00:00:20,534 --> 00:00:21,200
But don't worry.

6
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:23,741
We're not going to lose all that work we did on the examples.

7
00:00:23,741 --> 00:00:25,760


8
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:26,540
OK, so let's see.

9
00:00:26,540 --> 00:00:27,560
I've got the signature.

10
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:28,590
I've got the purpose.

11
00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:29,350
I've got to stop.

12
00:00:29,350 --> 00:00:30,266
I've got the examples.

13
00:00:30,266 --> 00:00:35,540
It's time to write function, the actual function definition.

14
00:00:35,540 --> 00:00:46,570
So let me go get the template because this function consumes list of school,

15
00:00:46,570 --> 00:00:47,850
comment out the stub.

16
00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:51,240


17
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:55,740
Now, let's see-- I copy down the template I rename the function

18
00:00:55,740 --> 00:00:59,210
and I rename the natural recursion.

19
00:00:59,210 --> 00:01:00,460
I'll start with the base case.

20
00:01:00,460 --> 00:01:01,700
Well, what happens in the base case?

21
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:03,200
What happens when the list is empty?

22
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:08,210
Well, what happens when the list is empty is just this thing right here.

23
00:01:08,210 --> 00:01:09,370
It's just this.

24
00:01:09,370 --> 00:01:15,380
In fact, you're allowed to copy from the examples to the function,

25
00:01:15,380 --> 00:01:18,630
not the other way around.

26
00:01:18,630 --> 00:01:22,139
So we'll put that right there so we don't type it.

27
00:01:22,139 --> 00:01:24,430
Now, remember the thing I showed you earlier this week.

28
00:01:24,430 --> 00:01:26,800
I can actually test this now.

29
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:29,971
And tests are going to fail.

30
00:01:29,971 --> 00:01:30,970
Tests are going to fail.

31
00:01:30,970 --> 00:01:34,090
But the first test that failed is actually the second one.

32
00:01:34,090 --> 00:01:38,135
The base case test has now run properly.

33
00:01:38,135 --> 00:01:40,760
It's not too surprising, because the base case of this function

34
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:42,530
wasn't very complicated.

35
00:01:42,530 --> 00:01:44,850
But the base case is running.

36
00:01:44,850 --> 00:01:47,790
Now, what we do here?

37
00:01:47,790 --> 00:01:49,220
Well, let's look at this.

38
00:01:49,220 --> 00:01:53,560
For a case where there's a school, where there's one school or maybe--

39
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:56,180
and then some rest of the list, here's a case

40
00:01:56,180 --> 00:01:58,770
where there's one school and some rest of the list.

41
00:01:58,770 --> 00:02:03,160
Let me change the line breaking so it's like that.

42
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:11,090
We do besides /align bottom of some complicated thing to do with

43
00:02:11,090 --> 00:02:17,240
the school, and then the result of the natural recursion.

44
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:21,110
Well, besides /align bottom seems like the combination.

45
00:02:21,110 --> 00:02:31,760


46
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:34,480
So that's the combination.

47
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:36,590
That's the natural recursion.

48
00:02:36,590 --> 00:02:43,460
So this whole complicated thing here, we've got to get that in here.

49
00:02:43,460 --> 00:02:45,245
Now, watch this.

50
00:02:45,245 --> 00:02:48,070
This is the consequence of the reference rule.

51
00:02:48,070 --> 00:02:52,060
This is what it means for something to be a natural helper.

52
00:02:52,060 --> 00:02:55,610
When you're working on a function like this

53
00:02:55,610 --> 00:03:00,750
and you see that you have to do something complicated with the school,

54
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:06,280
you have to do something complicated with the referred to type.

55
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:09,480
Remember, los refers to school.

56
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:12,390
List of school refers to school.

57
00:03:12,390 --> 00:03:16,620
And here, I have to do something complicated with a school.

58
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:20,650
When you've got this natural helper in the template, it's telling you,

59
00:03:20,650 --> 00:03:22,400
don't do it here.

60
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:23,210
Do it elsewhere.

61
00:03:23,210 --> 00:03:25,190
Make somebody else do it.

62
00:03:25,190 --> 00:03:26,260
Punt.

63
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:27,330
Wait.

64
00:03:27,330 --> 00:03:31,880
What it's telling you is, make a wish.

65
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:35,570
So instead of trying to do the whole school thing here,

66
00:03:35,570 --> 00:03:37,090
I'm just going to make a wish.

67
00:03:37,090 --> 00:03:39,270
I'm going to say, I wish there was a function called

68
00:03:39,270 --> 00:03:44,370
make bar that consumed a school and produced a single bar.

69
00:03:44,370 --> 00:03:46,860
I just wish that function existed.

70
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:50,690
And just as we have before, whenever we wish for a function,

71
00:03:50,690 --> 00:03:53,220
right now is when I write the wish list entry.

72
00:03:53,220 --> 00:04:00,080
So let's see-- I'm handing it a school, because first LOS produces a school.

73
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:01,320
So it gets a school.

74
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:03,440
It has to produce an image.

75
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:15,010
It has to produce the bar for a single school in the bar chart.

76
00:04:15,010 --> 00:04:18,149
In the stub-- it's a wish list, so we'll put bang bang bang.

77
00:04:18,149 --> 00:04:22,890
And the stub is defined make bar s.

78
00:04:22,890 --> 00:04:25,440
And then the stop for a function that produces

79
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:31,480
an image will say square 0 solid white.

80
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:34,740


81
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:36,545
And now I've wished for it.

82
00:04:36,545 --> 00:04:39,890
And I can run the test for chart right now.

83
00:04:39,890 --> 00:04:42,630
Now they're going to fail.

84
00:04:42,630 --> 00:04:45,860
They're going to fail, because the actual values are this.

85
00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:48,790
The actual values have nothing in them, because make bar

86
00:04:48,790 --> 00:04:53,700
keeps making these blank images.

87
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:56,380
But in some very real sense now, chart is done,

88
00:04:56,380 --> 00:05:00,500
or at least chart looks like it's done, if only we have make bar,

89
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:05,150
then chart would probably run unless there's some mistakes in it.

90
00:05:05,150 --> 00:05:09,200
What happened here is I wished for what's called a helper function.

91
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:12,200
And the reason I did that goes back to that picture

92
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:19,420
we saw about the type comments for these types and the templates.

93
00:05:19,420 --> 00:05:23,630
Right here in this type comment, there's a reference.

94
00:05:23,630 --> 00:05:28,660
And the reference produces a natural helper in the template.

95
00:05:28,660 --> 00:05:32,380
And what that meant was when we got here-- I'll back it up a second.

96
00:05:32,380 --> 00:05:36,050


97
00:05:36,050 --> 00:05:39,230
We got here and we were thinking about doing this complicated stuff

98
00:05:39,230 --> 00:05:41,620
for the individual school.

99
00:05:41,620 --> 00:05:44,660
But the template was saying, fun for school.

100
00:05:44,660 --> 00:05:47,940
And what fun for school says to us is it says, no, no, no.

101
00:05:47,940 --> 00:05:53,130
If what you have to do with school is complicated, don't do it here.

102
00:05:53,130 --> 00:05:54,540
Wish for it.

103
00:05:54,540 --> 00:05:58,730
And that's why we decided to wish for it.

104
00:05:58,730 --> 00:06:00,870
Now, what's the actual rule for complicated?

105
00:06:00,870 --> 00:06:05,410
You should go check the recipe pages for the reference rule for this.

106
00:06:05,410 --> 00:06:10,850
But the basic rule is, if you have to call more than one function that

107
00:06:10,850 --> 00:06:14,535
operates on school, make a helper.

108
00:06:14,535 --> 00:06:16,660
So if it turned out that all you needed to do here,

109
00:06:16,660 --> 00:06:19,240
for example, was call a selector on school,

110
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:21,090
you wouldn't need to make a new function.

111
00:06:21,090 --> 00:06:24,454
If it turns out that the new function you need already exists,

112
00:06:24,454 --> 00:06:26,120
then you don't need to make another one.

113
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:29,360
You could call a function that already exists.

114
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:33,220
But the idea here is that whenever I see fun for school in the template,

115
00:06:33,220 --> 00:06:38,680
I want to see a single call to a function that consumes school.

116
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:39,930
Let's just finish this up now.

117
00:06:39,930 --> 00:06:42,700
We're almost done.

118
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:45,510
Let's see-- make bar.

119
00:06:45,510 --> 00:06:46,080
Check expect.

120
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:49,010


121
00:06:49,010 --> 00:06:50,290
Make bar.

122
00:06:50,290 --> 00:06:53,000
Now all this work I did up here to figure out

123
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:57,260
exactly what I want to see for an individual school,

124
00:06:57,260 --> 00:06:58,970
I'm allowed to reuse that work now.

125
00:06:58,970 --> 00:07:07,350


126
00:07:07,350 --> 00:07:12,710
I'm allowed to do this and say, I know what I want that to look like.

127
00:07:12,710 --> 00:07:14,310
I figured it out before.

128
00:07:14,310 --> 00:07:17,250
I want it to look like this.

129
00:07:17,250 --> 00:07:23,336


130
00:07:23,336 --> 00:07:24,710
So there's a single check expect.

131
00:07:24,710 --> 00:07:25,550
I only need one.

132
00:07:25,550 --> 00:07:33,790


133
00:07:33,790 --> 00:07:37,565
Let me go get the template for school.

134
00:07:37,565 --> 00:07:50,400


135
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:53,500
I'll comment out the stub.

136
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:54,710
I'll rename this function.

137
00:07:54,710 --> 00:07:57,370


138
00:07:57,370 --> 00:08:01,430
And I got to do this whole complicated thing.

139
00:08:01,430 --> 00:08:15,850
Overlay, align of center bottom and then rotate 90.

140
00:08:15,850 --> 00:08:19,380
And then the text of the school name-- there's

141
00:08:19,380 --> 00:08:30,580
where the school name comes in for s1, font size, font color, that's the name.

142
00:08:30,580 --> 00:08:34,280
And then let's see what else do we got.

143
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:38,210
We've got a rectangle-- whoops, not a capital rectangle--

144
00:08:38,210 --> 00:08:49,460
rectangle of the bar width and times the tuition,

145
00:08:49,460 --> 00:08:52,690
whatever the tuition is, the Y scale.

146
00:08:52,690 --> 00:08:56,540


147
00:08:56,540 --> 00:09:01,270
And that rectangle is outlined in black.

148
00:09:01,270 --> 00:09:06,350
And there's another rectangle, which is the same size

149
00:09:06,350 --> 00:09:13,335
but it's solid-- and bar color.

150
00:09:13,335 --> 00:09:16,090


151
00:09:16,090 --> 00:09:18,870
Let's try that.

152
00:09:18,870 --> 00:09:21,780
All four tests pass.

153
00:09:21,780 --> 00:09:22,784
All four tests pass.

154
00:09:22,784 --> 00:09:25,200
Let me show it to you down here just so you really see it.

155
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:31,650
If I say chart on LOS 1, I get blank because that's the base case.

156
00:09:31,650 --> 00:09:38,070
But if I say chart LOS 2, I get that little chart.

157
00:09:38,070 --> 00:09:42,010
So two things about this example-- really important to see.

158
00:09:42,010 --> 00:09:46,030
One, we've seen before but it's always worth remembering,

159
00:09:46,030 --> 00:09:48,364
which is when we were doing the examples,

160
00:09:48,364 --> 00:09:50,280
it might have seemed to you, when are we going

161
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:53,590
to get there, when are we going to get there, when we going to get there?

162
00:09:53,590 --> 00:09:56,910
But notice how at the end it all happened really fast.

163
00:09:56,910 --> 00:09:59,430
That's because we spent so much time figuring out

164
00:09:59,430 --> 00:10:03,210
what we really, really wanted when we were doing the examples.

165
00:10:03,210 --> 00:10:04,210
So that's an old point.

166
00:10:04,210 --> 00:10:05,860
We've seen that point before.

167
00:10:05,860 --> 00:10:09,430
The new point has to do with the reference relationship in these types.

168
00:10:09,430 --> 00:10:12,020
Because these types have a reference relationship in them,

169
00:10:12,020 --> 00:10:17,250
the template for list of school has a natural helper in it.

170
00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:19,830
And what that meant was that we were sitting right here,

171
00:10:19,830 --> 00:10:24,170
trying to figure out how to do this complicated thing with a single school.

172
00:10:24,170 --> 00:10:29,110
The template was staring us in the face saying, fun for school, which means,

173
00:10:29,110 --> 00:10:30,850
don't do the complicated thing here.

174
00:10:30,850 --> 00:10:32,320
Do it in a helper.

175
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:35,350
So we wished for a helper, then we designed the helper,

176
00:10:35,350 --> 00:10:37,310
and we were all done.

177
00:10:37,310 --> 00:10:39,440
What we've seen in this sample is something

178
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:42,790
that's really critical to good software design, which

179
00:10:42,790 --> 00:10:45,270
is that the structure of the information flows

180
00:10:45,270 --> 00:10:49,640
all the way through to the structure of the functions in the program.

181
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:52,320
What we saw at the beginning was that we decided

182
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:55,070
the structure of the information was naturally

183
00:10:55,070 --> 00:10:58,950
information about schools and information

184
00:10:58,950 --> 00:11:02,420
about an arbitrary number of those schools.

185
00:11:02,420 --> 00:11:06,790
And what that did was it put a reference relationship in the type comment.

186
00:11:06,790 --> 00:11:11,220
And that reference relationship in the type comment led to a natural helper

187
00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:18,310
in the templates, which led to a helper function call in the actual functions.

188
00:11:18,310 --> 00:11:21,960
So what's really key here, designing data

189
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:26,210
is actually making important decisions about the design of functions.

190
00:11:26,210 --> 00:11:28,300
And we're going to see that again and again

191
00:11:28,300 --> 00:11:30,710
in the next few weeks of the course.

192
00:11:30,710 --> 00:11:31,210
