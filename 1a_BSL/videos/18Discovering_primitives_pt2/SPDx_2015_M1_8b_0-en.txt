Gregor Kiczales: So that's two ways you can discover new primitives.
You can either guess-- and you'd be surprised how often you get lucky--
or you can look up the documentation for an existing primitive
and scroll around to find related primitives.
As you program more and more, you'll get to know more and more primitives,
and you'll be able to guess lucky more often.
You're also going to see that programming environments-- that's
editors like DrRacket-- have tools that help you guess more quickly.
And we'll look at some of those in later weeks of the course.
