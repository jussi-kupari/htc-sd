Gregor Kiczales: So that's two ways you can discover new primitives.

2
00:00:03,970 --> 00:00:08,410
You can either guess-- and you'd be surprised how often you get lucky--

3
00:00:08,410 --> 00:00:11,710
or you can look up the documentation for an existing primitive

4
00:00:11,710 --> 00:00:15,790
and scroll around to find related primitives.

5
00:00:15,790 --> 00:00:19,610
As you program more and more, you'll get to know more and more primitives,

6
00:00:19,610 --> 00:00:23,470
and you'll be able to guess lucky more often.

7
00:00:23,470 --> 00:00:26,400
You're also going to see that programming environments-- that's

8
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:31,660
editors like DrRacket-- have tools that help you guess more quickly.

9
00:00:31,660 --> 00:00:34,910
And we'll look at some of those in later weeks of the course.
