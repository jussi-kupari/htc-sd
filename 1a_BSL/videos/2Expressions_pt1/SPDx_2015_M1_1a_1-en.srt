00:00:03,987 --> 00:00:06,070
GREGOR KICZALES: So as I said in the introduction,

2
00:00:06,070 --> 00:00:07,778
we're going to design some great programs

3
00:00:07,778 --> 00:00:12,740
in this course-- some games, some animations, some information

4
00:00:12,740 --> 00:00:14,620
visualization, some web programs.

5
00:00:14,620 --> 00:00:16,930
Really great stuff.

6
00:00:16,930 --> 00:00:21,204
But the thing is, you got to walk before you can run.

7
00:00:21,204 --> 00:00:24,370
And in the same way, we've got to learn some basic building blocks before we

8
00:00:24,370 --> 00:00:26,810
can build these great programs.

9
00:00:26,810 --> 00:00:29,366
So that's what we're going to do for the next few videos is

10
00:00:29,366 --> 00:00:31,490
learn some basic building blocks out of which we're

11
00:00:31,490 --> 00:00:34,050
going to build bigger programs.

12
00:00:34,050 --> 00:00:37,120
We're going to try to do it quickly because it isn't that exciting.

13
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:40,300
But we're going to try not to do it too quickly because we want everybody

14
00:00:40,300 --> 00:00:42,370
to be able to stay with us.

15
00:00:42,370 --> 00:00:47,540
So if maybe you've programmed before and this video seems a little slow,

16
00:00:47,540 --> 00:00:49,631
then feel free to speed it up.

17
00:00:49,631 --> 00:00:51,380
But most of the people who take this class

18
00:00:51,380 --> 00:00:53,120
haven't programmed before, so we're going

19
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:55,524
to try to go a good speed for that.

20
00:00:55,524 --> 00:00:57,440
And if the video's a little too fast, then you

21
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:01,320
can replay the part of the video that you need to replay.

22
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:05,830
As we go through it, I'd encourage you to have DrRacket open and follow along

23
00:01:05,830 --> 00:01:08,350
with the examples that I'm going to do.

24
00:01:08,350 --> 00:01:10,550
So here we go.

25
00:01:10,550 --> 00:01:13,010
When we start Racket for the first time, we

26
00:01:13,010 --> 00:01:16,460
have to tell it what language we're going to use.

27
00:01:16,460 --> 00:01:20,070
Your Racket may have started up already saying, Beginning student language,

28
00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:21,900
down in this lower left corner.

29
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:23,400
And if it did, then you're all set.

30
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:25,470
You don't need to do anything.

31
00:01:25,470 --> 00:01:29,090
But if it didn't, then go to the Language menu.

32
00:01:29,090 --> 00:01:32,050
Say Choose Language.

33
00:01:32,050 --> 00:01:36,500
Make sure the How To Design Program part is opened up

34
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:38,754
and choose Beginning Student.

35
00:01:38,754 --> 00:01:41,170
The way you'll get to this menu will be slightly different

36
00:01:41,170 --> 00:01:44,740
in Windows, of course, but you're going to want to go to the Language menu

37
00:01:44,740 --> 00:01:45,630
to do that.

38
00:01:45,630 --> 00:01:48,900
So go to the Language menu and select Beginning Student Language,

39
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:51,630
and then you'll be all set to go.

40
00:01:51,630 --> 00:01:55,090
Now that that's done, we can get started.

41
00:01:55,090 --> 00:01:57,930
The top part of Racket here is called the Definitions Area,

42
00:01:57,930 --> 00:02:01,340
and the bottom part is called the Interaction Area.

43
00:02:01,340 --> 00:02:04,025
We're going to start by working up in the Definitions Area.

44
00:02:04,025 --> 00:02:07,920
And we're going to start by writing a simple arithmetic expression.

45
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:11,470
I'll just put plus 3 4.

46
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:14,400
This is how we're going to say to add three to four

47
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:17,700
in the beginning student language.

48
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:21,730
And if I ask DrRacket to run that short program, it will.

49
00:02:21,730 --> 00:02:24,590
And down here, it tells me that the result of that program

50
00:02:24,590 --> 00:02:26,930
is 7, which isn't so surprising.

51
00:02:26,930 --> 00:02:29,920
Adding 3 to 4 should produce 7.

52
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:32,570
This is what's called an expression.

53
00:02:32,570 --> 00:02:36,460
And in the bottom window, we have what's called a value.

54
00:02:36,460 --> 00:02:39,190
And the way Racket is working is we give it expressions,

55
00:02:39,190 --> 00:02:42,360
and it evaluates the expression to produce the value.

56
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:44,250
Expressions can be more complicated.

57
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:51,770
For example, we could say plus 3 times 2 3.

58
00:02:51,770 --> 00:02:58,184
And we can run that program, and no surprise, it produces 9.

59
00:02:58,184 --> 00:03:00,850
We can make expressions that are even more complicated than that

60
00:03:00,850 --> 00:03:03,830
or use other primitive operators.

61
00:03:03,830 --> 00:03:11,020
Here we'll just divide 12 by times 2 3.

62
00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:16,490
And unsurprisingly, that will give us 2.

63
00:03:16,490 --> 00:03:20,840
So what we've seen so far is that the rule for the way we form an expression

64
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:25,710
is open parenthesis, the name of a primitive operator, like plus

65
00:03:25,710 --> 00:03:31,090
or times or slash, and then any number of other expressions followed

66
00:03:31,090 --> 00:03:32,717
by a close parenthesis.

67
00:03:32,717 --> 00:03:35,550
And there's another rule that says expressions can be actual values.

68
00:03:35,550 --> 00:03:37,555
So numbers themselves can be expressions.

69
00:03:37,555 --> 00:03:40,170


70
00:03:40,170 --> 00:03:42,370
Let me show you another thing we can do.

71
00:03:42,370 --> 00:03:46,250
We could take all of this, and if we say to Racket Comment That Out

72
00:03:46,250 --> 00:03:49,485
with Semicolons, then it'll put a semicolon

73
00:03:49,485 --> 00:03:51,080
in front of each of those lines.

74
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:55,280
And what that tells Racket is, for now, it should ignore everything on a line

75
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:56,970
after the first semicolon.

76
00:03:56,970 --> 00:03:59,731
So if I would run this program now, as far as Racket's concerned,

77
00:03:59,731 --> 00:04:01,355
there's no expressions in there at all.

78
00:04:01,355 --> 00:04:04,030
And so there's no values that come out.

79
00:04:04,030 --> 00:04:07,780
Let me tell you about two more primitive operations on numbers,

80
00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:10,390
and then I'll ask you to do an exercise.

81
00:04:10,390 --> 00:04:13,340
The first one is sqr.

82
00:04:13,340 --> 00:04:14,785
We call it square.

83
00:04:14,785 --> 00:04:18,589
And if I take square of 3-- and I'll show you

84
00:04:18,589 --> 00:04:23,290
another one here at the same time-- square root of 16,

85
00:04:23,290 --> 00:04:26,710
and I'll run these two.

86
00:04:26,710 --> 00:04:32,860
And what you're seeing is that square squares the number, and square root

87
00:04:32,860 --> 00:04:37,190
produces the square root of a number.

88
00:04:37,190 --> 00:04:37,690
OK.

89
00:04:37,690 --> 00:04:40,141
We've seen how to form expressions.

90
00:04:40,141 --> 00:04:41,890
And we've seen a number of primitives that

91
00:04:41,890 --> 00:04:46,830
operate on numbers, primitives like plus, and times, and divide, and minus,

92
00:04:46,830 --> 00:04:49,910
and square, and square root.

93
00:04:49,910 --> 00:04:52,300
What I'd like to do now is give you an exercise

94
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:55,572
that you can use to help reinforce what we've learned so far.

95
00:04:55,572 --> 00:04:58,405
We'll have exercises like this throughout the videos in this course.

96
00:04:58,405 --> 00:05:00,155
I'd like to encourage you to take the time

97
00:05:00,155 --> 00:05:04,580
to do them just to test your understanding of what's come so far.

98
00:05:04,580 --> 00:05:05,990
So here's the exercise.

99
00:05:05,990 --> 00:05:07,980
I've got it in a separate file.

100
00:05:07,980 --> 00:05:10,472
And let me just explain this big box.

101
00:05:10,472 --> 00:05:13,680
Racket has a thing called a comment box, which you can actually add to a file

102
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:16,600
yourself under the Insert menu.

103
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:19,950
And the way to think of a comment box is, see this semicolon here?

104
00:05:19,950 --> 00:05:23,855
It's basically saying everything in the box is a comment.

105
00:05:23,855 --> 00:05:25,770
And what's also neat about Racket is that you

106
00:05:25,770 --> 00:05:27,790
can put images in the middle of files.

107
00:05:27,790 --> 00:05:30,800
That's just an image that I cut and pasted.

108
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:33,380
At any rate, here's the exercise.

109
00:05:33,380 --> 00:05:34,910
Go ahead and work on it.

110
00:05:34,910 --> 00:05:36,830
Write the expression.
