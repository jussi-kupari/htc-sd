00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:03,900
GREGOR KICZALES: Let me just quickly show you how I think about it.

2
00:00:03,900 --> 00:00:13,582
Given the formula, I know that I need to square 3, and I need to square 4,

3
00:00:13,582 --> 00:00:18,920
and I need to add those together, and I need

4
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:22,784
to take the square root of that whole thing.

5
00:00:22,784 --> 00:00:27,310
And if I run that, I get 5.

6
00:00:27,310 --> 00:00:30,310
Sure enough.

7
00:00:30,310 --> 00:00:33,560
Let me say a word here about math.

8
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:35,810
The Pythagorean theorem here is pretty much

9
00:00:35,810 --> 00:00:38,290
the hardest math we're going to do in this whole course.

10
00:00:38,290 --> 00:00:42,280
And that's important because you need to know that to design a lot of programs,

11
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:44,080
you don't need to know a lot of math.

12
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:48,065
You can be a very good program designer without knowing a lot of math.

13
00:00:48,065 --> 00:00:49,940
There are certain kinds of programs, programs

14
00:00:49,940 --> 00:00:52,400
in graphics or vision or machine learning,

15
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:55,120
where you do need to know a lot of math.

16
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:58,470
That's because you need to understand that domain.

17
00:00:58,470 --> 00:01:00,690
We won't do a lot of math in this course, though.

18
00:01:00,690 --> 00:01:03,920
The Pythagorean theorem here is about the hardest we'll do.

19
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:06,400
There is, however, one little detail I need to tell you.

20
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:11,280
A little bit more math, and then we'll go on.

21
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:18,030
If I take the square root of 2 and run that-- look at this funny thing

22
00:01:18,030 --> 00:01:21,040
Racket is telling me that I see.

23
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:23,120
Why is that?

24
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:26,230
Well, you may know that the square root of 2 is an irrational number.

25
00:01:26,230 --> 00:01:28,100
And what it means to be an irrational number

26
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:32,890
is that it takes infinite space to write the number down.

27
00:01:32,890 --> 00:01:35,180
Well, computers are not infinite in size.

28
00:01:35,180 --> 00:01:36,990
They're quite finite in size.

29
00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:39,000
So it has no way of representing a number that

30
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,450
takes infinite space to write it down.

31
00:01:41,450 --> 00:01:44,530
So what this means-- this sharp sign "I" and a number means

32
00:01:44,530 --> 00:01:46,320
it's an inexact number.

33
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:49,140
It's telling you that the number is pretty close to this number

34
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:51,340
here, but not exactly.

35
00:01:51,340 --> 00:01:53,900
And you may see numbers like that crop up.

36
00:01:53,900 --> 00:01:54,870
Don't worry about it.

37
00:01:54,870 --> 00:01:57,289
It'll usually come up in some kinds of graphic programs,

38
00:01:57,289 --> 00:02:00,080
and you won't be able to see the difference between the two numbers

39
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:00,580
anyways.

40
00:02:00,580 --> 00:02:03,050


41
00:02:03,050 --> 00:02:03,680
OK.

42
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:06,498
Now you've seen how to write expressions that operate on numbers.

43
00:02:06,498 --> 00:02:08,539
At this point you should have a pretty good sense

44
00:02:08,539 --> 00:02:11,430
of how to write such expressions, and an intuitive understanding

45
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:14,010
of what they're going to evaluate to.

46
00:02:14,010 --> 00:02:17,090
In the next video, we're going to look at the more precise rules

47
00:02:17,090 --> 00:02:20,285
that Racket uses for evaluating them.

48
00:02:20,285 --> 00:02:23,070
You may wonder at this point are there more primitives that

49
00:02:23,070 --> 00:02:24,000
operate on numbers?

50
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,780
And the answer is that there are lots, lots, and lots and lots.

51
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:31,250
Far more than you could hope to learn at this point.

52
00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:33,610
But if you want to discover some of those primitives,

53
00:02:33,610 --> 00:02:36,520
I suggest you jump ahead to the video on discovering

54
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:38,980
primitives that comes later this week.

55
00:02:38,980 --> 00:02:42,550
Of course, it's also fine to just stick with the primitives we learn now-- plus

56
00:02:42,550 --> 00:02:45,880
and times and minus and square and square root.

57
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:47,439
