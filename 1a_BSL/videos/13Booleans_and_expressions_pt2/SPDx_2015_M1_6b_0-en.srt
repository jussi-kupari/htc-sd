00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:03,470
GREGOR KICZALES: OK, so that's Boolean values true and false

2
00:00:03,470 --> 00:00:07,140
and a number of predicates that are questions

3
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:09,430
that produce true-false answers.

4
00:00:09,430 --> 00:00:12,270
Now I want to talk about if expressions, which

5
00:00:12,270 --> 00:00:16,120
are going to let us have our program produce different results depending

6
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:18,840
on the answer to true-false questions-- depending

7
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:21,350
on the result produced by a predicate.

8
00:00:21,350 --> 00:00:23,830
If expressions are simple to form.

9
00:00:23,830 --> 00:00:30,420
It's open paren if and then three expressions and a close paren.

10
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:33,590
We call those three expressions the question, the true answer,

11
00:00:33,590 --> 00:00:36,080
and the false answer.

12
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:38,150
And one key thing is the question expression

13
00:00:38,150 --> 00:00:40,730
has to produce a Boolean value.

14
00:00:40,730 --> 00:00:44,780
So the question expression usually calls a predicate of some form.

15
00:00:44,780 --> 00:00:46,630
Now let's look at an example.

16
00:00:46,630 --> 00:00:48,960
Going back to where we were, let me start

17
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:51,740
by just deleting this expression here and then we'll

18
00:00:51,740 --> 00:00:57,400
try to write an if expression that determines what the shape is of i one.

19
00:00:57,400 --> 00:01:00,530
So we'll say open paren if, and then let's

20
00:01:00,530 --> 00:01:08,095
say less than-- is the width of I1 less than the height of I1?

21
00:01:08,095 --> 00:01:13,710


22
00:01:13,710 --> 00:01:16,720
And if that's true, that's the question.

23
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:22,050
The question is true, then here is the true answer.

24
00:01:22,050 --> 00:01:23,820
We're going to say that the image is tall

25
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:25,860
if its width is less than its height.

26
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:30,720
And in the false answer, we'll say that the image is wide.

27
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:35,520
And if I run that now, there's two interesting things to see here.

28
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:38,750
One is that the result was tall because sure enough,

29
00:01:38,750 --> 00:01:41,140
I1 is taller than it is wide.

30
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:45,430
And the other interesting thing to see was that right here, this piece of code

31
00:01:45,430 --> 00:01:47,167
was highlighted in black.

32
00:01:47,167 --> 00:01:49,250
Depending on which version of racket you're using,

33
00:01:49,250 --> 00:01:50,666
it might be highlighted in orange.

34
00:01:50,666 --> 00:01:52,540
But it's highlighted.

35
00:01:52,540 --> 00:01:55,780
We're going to talk a lot more about that later this week.

36
00:01:55,780 --> 00:01:58,890
But if I go ahead now and switch around, maybe I

37
00:01:58,890 --> 00:02:02,710
ask the question about I2 instead of I1.

38
00:02:02,710 --> 00:02:05,790
Well, I2's width is greater than its height, and in this case,

39
00:02:05,790 --> 00:02:09,210
if we evaluate the expression, it produces wide

40
00:02:09,210 --> 00:02:13,610
and the other-- the true answer this time-- is highlighted in black.

41
00:02:13,610 --> 00:02:16,860
So you may be able to start to guess what that black highlighting means,

42
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:19,168
but again, we'll talk about that later.

43
00:02:19,168 --> 00:02:19,668
