GREGOR KICZALES: So now you've seen the How to Design Functions Recipe,

2
00:00:03,610 --> 00:00:06,700
and you've seen me work through four examples of it,

3
00:00:06,700 --> 00:00:10,490
where each example showed some more wrinkles to the process.

4
00:00:10,490 --> 00:00:13,320
What you should do now is go work through all the practice

5
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:18,240
problems for this week, and then do the homework problems and the quiz.

6
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:20,140
Let me stress something about this material.

7
00:00:20,140 --> 00:00:23,280
I just can't make this point strongly enough.

8
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:26,870
This is the kind of material that you learn by doing.

9
00:00:26,870 --> 00:00:30,090
I really want to encourage you, don't look at the problem

10
00:00:30,090 --> 00:00:32,159
and then look at the solution.

11
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:37,190
If you do that, you're going to say to yourself, oh, I know how to do this.

12
00:00:37,190 --> 00:00:40,100
You need to actually take the blank starter file

13
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:43,420
and work through the problem yourself from beginning to end.

14
00:00:43,420 --> 00:00:47,010
That's the only way to learn this kind of material.

15
00:00:47,010 --> 00:00:49,860
At any rate, have fun with the practice problems and the homework,

16
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:52,200
and I'll see you next week.
